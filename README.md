# Blocks_game

This is a simple game designed in Python. This game was designed in my free time and needs a minor updates but is a fun game to play. 

The basic design of this game similar to a blocks game where, you are assigned one red block and blue blocks randomly fall from the top of the screen. In order to gain scores you need to ensure that the blue blocks never touch your red block. To do this you can use left aroow key and right arrow key.
